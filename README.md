# My Portfolio

A personal portfolio built with **React + TypeScript** to showcase my projects, work experience, and contact information.  
Data is loaded dynamically from a single JSON file (`resumeData.json`) so it can be reused across apps.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node) or yarn/pnpm

### Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd my-portfolio
npm install
```

### Running the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 📂 Project Structure
```perl

├── public/

### 🧩 How It Works

- resumeData.json contains:
    - projects (portfolio work, games, thesis, etc.)
    - work_experience (job history)
    - educational experience (schools attended, classes, degrees)
- App.tsx:
    - Loads the JSON once with fetch()
    - Splits into projects and jobs
    - Normalizes them into a shared Item type
    - Filters and displays them based on:
        - Tab selection (Projects, Jobs, About, Contact)
        - Search term (matches title, description, tags)
- ProjectCard.tsx handles rendering a project card.
- Jobs are rendered inline as job-card.

### 🖼 Features
- ✅ Tabs for navigation (Projects / Jobs / About / Contact)
- ✅ Search bar filters by keywords/tags
- ✅ Dynamic JSON loading (no need to hardcode)
- ✅ TypeScript for safer data handling
- 🔜 Click-through to project/job detail pages
- 🔜 Image support for projects/jobs

### 🛠 Common Commands
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### ⚠️ Notes for Future You
- Don’t edit resumeData.json — it’s reused by other apps. Instead, adapt parsing in App.tsx.
- Jobs may not always have description; we filter those out to prevent errors.
- id: i + 1000 offset prevents collisions between project IDs and job IDs.
- If you see two node_modules folders:
    - Delete the extra one outside my-portfolio/.
    - Run npm install in the correct root.

### 📌 To-Do / Future Improvements
- [ ] Dedicated pages for each project/job (React Router under `src/pages/`)
- [ ] Image gallery support for projects (stored in `src/assets/` or URLs in JSON)
- [ ] Better styling for job cards (make consistent with ProjectCard)
- [ ] Add CI/CD for deployment
- [ ] Write tests for filtering and search
